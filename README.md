## Shopping Portal using PHP and MySQL


# Usage

1. Clone the above repository on your machine by forking it or download it from [this](https://github.com/karanjthakkar/shopping-portal/archive/master.zip) link, incase you are unfamiliar with `github`.
2. Install [WAMP Server](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) on your Windows machine to setup Apache, PHP and MySQL all in one go. Just download it from [here](http://www.wampserver.com/en/#download-wrapper). Once you finish the download, install it with all the default settings. You'll have to select the `.exe` file of your default browser. If you have firefox, that wont be necessary though.
3. Once you have WAMP Server up and running, just copy the files you downloaded in step 1, into the `www` directory of wamp installation. By default it is `C:\wamp\www`.
4. After that, go to your browser and type `localhost/phpmyadmin`. Click on the tab named `Databases` on the top and create a new database named `shoppingportal`. *DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE DATABASE* Now, click on the newly created database. Click on the tab named `Import` on the top. Choose the file `shoppingportal.sql` from the files you downloaded in step 1.
5. Thats it! (: You are good to go and test the php scripts. Start by typing `localhost/index.php` in your default browser.
